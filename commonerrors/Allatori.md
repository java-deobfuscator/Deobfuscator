## Flow Obfuscation
The latest versions of Allatori contain some flow obfuscation which moves around some instructions, so it is necessary to run allatori.FlowObfuscationTransformer to fix this. This transformer should always work, but if it doesn't, open an issue! Note: It is not necessary to run this before allatori.StringEncryptionTransformer.

<!-- 
    If this issue is a bug report (i.e. something wasn't deobfuscated),
    please read the FAQs first (bottom of the README).
    
    Please make sure that you've provided a copy of the file you're deobfuscation if possible.
    If you don't have permission to provide the entire program or you don't want to,
    then there's not much I can do. I'm not psychic.
    
    You should also provide a copy of the config/code you're using to run the deobfuscator.
    Order of transformers matter, and sometimes you just need to switch them around.
    Please paste the config/code in a code block. Here's how to do that: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting
    
    Thank you!
